# What is Dot Rest PHP?
Dot Rest PHP is a tool that simplifies the process of testing and interacting with HTTP-based APIs. It allows users to
write simple plain text files to execute HTTP requests and test or retrieve the resulting data. Some of its key features
include native PHP code execution, external file inclusion, chaining HTTP requests, and capturing data from response
body, headers, and cookies using JSONPath and XPath expressions. It also includes an "assert" directive for testing
responses using regex, JSONPath, and XPath expressions.
